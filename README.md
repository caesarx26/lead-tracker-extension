# lead-tracker-extension
 This is a chrome extension that keeps track of websites or tabs that you come across. The extension stores them so you can access them later.
 For the delete button you need to double click it to delete all the leads and all other buttons are 1 click.
 the tab feature only works when it is being used as an extension and not when it is loaded as a webpage.
