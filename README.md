# lead-tracker-extension
This is a Chrome extension that keeps track of websites or tabs that you come across. The extension stores them so you can access them later.

# How to add as a Chrome extension 
download this repo and unzip it, go to your extensions, click load unpacked, and then upload the unzipped folder 

 # how to use 
For the delete button you need to double-click it in order to delete all the leads and all other buttons are 1 click.
The tab feature only works when it is being used as an extension and not when it is loaded as a webpage.
